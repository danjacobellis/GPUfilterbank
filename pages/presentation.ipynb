    "A current trend of audio signal processing research is to apply 2D convolutional neural networks to time-frequency representations of audio. Although great progress was made in the pre-deep learning era on perfect reconstruction filterbanks and wavelet transforms, most of the algorithms and techniques have been abandoned by practitioners of deep learning because no standardized and free implementations were ever widely disseminated. As a result, the standarized set of triangular \"Mel\" filterbanks dating back nearly 50 years appears to have remained the dominant tool, and have even seen a resurgance despite their [impending obsolescence.][1]\n",

    "# Haar Decomposition\n",
    "(Draft) Haar decomposition is one of the simplest wavelet transform that has perfect reconstruction property, thus is a good introduction example. First of all, note that the input is a sequence of integers, because we are dealing digital data after sampling from raw data, such as audio. By performing two convolutions with the input, we get a low-frequency component and a high-frequency component.\n",
    "As we can see, the sum and difference of the high and low frequency components forms a splitted signal of the original signal, which we can merge to retain the original one. This is an example of “critically sampled” dyadic filterbank, which means that the size of data after applying the filter is exactly same as original data. Note that, “dyadic filters” refers “dynamic analysis filters”, the type of filtering that consists of a filtering followed by downsampling. There is an inverse operation, which is synthetic filters. (Which we are dealing by convolution. We will get to this detail later)"
